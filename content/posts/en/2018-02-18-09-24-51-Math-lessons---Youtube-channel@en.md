I spent some time to get information about physics and math which can be interesting, simple to understand for me and for my children. I found Feynman lectures 
but it is hard to find similar about math. I could not find it. Some month ago I watched Savvateev's lessons at Phillipovsakya school. He plans to record 100 video lessons. 
One thing I dislike is that video was chunked. I wanted to improve it and merged it and also removed background noise. Next, I named lessons like "Lesson %num. %title", created
cover for video. I asked for my idea to Alexey and got approve. So let me introduce my youtube channel [Math lessons](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCejeO1MwyaE8VGK39eYkKOg)
