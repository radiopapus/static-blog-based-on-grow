Watched "Pozner". There was a Ksenia Sochak in studio. A candidate for president of the Russian Federation. There was a question in programm "Why people do not interesting in freedom of speech in Russia". It think is is out of range because people think about how to to feed a family. I live in Tomsk and average sallary here is 20-25 thousand of rubbles. Food, services and medicine take more than 70-80% of families budget. People have no time to think about freedom, they want to eat.

I like Pozner, especially this interview. Ksenia was honest, it seems to me.
