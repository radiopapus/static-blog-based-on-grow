        I have got wine recently. It was Vranac from Monte Negro. It would be complicated to buy it in Tomsk. I like it. People say Vranac is very similar to Pino noir but I have never taste it before.
        Today I got a message from my coursemate Anton and he said he wanted to meet. He presented to me wine from Georgia. Saperavi Qvevri. True, Georgian. Brilliant, I am so happy. I am not going to taste it near 3 days and want to share it with my family. They have a rest in a country. I can't taste it without my Tanya that's because he loves taste something really unique so I am going to wait.
