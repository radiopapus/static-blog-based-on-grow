My wife has presented to me practical shooting course. Yesterday, I shot from MP 443 Grach gun.

I felt so tired. Shooting requires concentration. I passed an exam and trainer introduced me shooting codex and gun. I can't say that it was exciting because I need some time to clarify my feelings and to make suggestions. Anyway it was new experience so I am grateful.
Next time I am going to shoot from another gun (Makarov maybe). I would like to compare.
