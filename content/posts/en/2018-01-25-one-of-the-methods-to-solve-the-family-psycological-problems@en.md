We argue sometimes. Talk has several disadvantages. You should completely understand what you want to say and express it as clear as possible. There is a probability to interrupt each other and continue argue often and challenge is not to interrupt and listen.
I do not remember when exactly we started to use our letters method. It is an old and useful practice for us.

We write letters to each other if we want to express disagreement, dissatisfaction, if something went wrong and make our life uncomfortable. We usually use notebook for this purposes. Everybody writes what they want, what is important for him/her. Often we read it and discuss. It seems to me dialog is more constructive after that.%
