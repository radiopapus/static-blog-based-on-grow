$title: Shooting from MP 443 Grach
---
My wife has presented to me practical shooting course. Yesterday, I shot from MP 443 Grach gun.

It seemed to me that I will be relaxed after shooting but I felt so tired. Shooting requires concentration.
First of all, I passed and exam and trainer introduced me shooting codex and gun. My shooting has medium level as a novice I have trouble and I could not hold on gun in the right way so I got bullets at 7 and 8 o'clock. I can't say that it was exciting. I need some time for understanding. I need to repeat it to make suggestions. As a disadvantages I can notice that shooting gallery has not enough light.
Next time I am going to shoot from another gun (Makarov). I want to compare.
