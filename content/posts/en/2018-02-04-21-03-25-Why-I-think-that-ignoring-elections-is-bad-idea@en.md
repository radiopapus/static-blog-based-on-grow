$title: Why I think that ignoring elections is a bad idea
---
18 of March is an elections in Russia. Perhaps, it is first time for a long time when I want to make choice. It is inconvinient for me due to geo reason, but I want.
This post is a reason to express my disagreement to current situation with Navalny's appeal. He appeals to skip elections because he is not allowed to elections. This post will contain my opinion about it and I think that every man always has a choice.

First of all, we have more than one candidates and formally we have a choice at all. We can make demagogy about like, dislike, to choose or not to choose and so on.

Secondly, I suppose elections in 2018 like a election in 2000 is represented by real candidates and we should consider each of all, read a program, try to know about candidate's team.

I think Zhirinovsy is nominal candidate. Old experience said he has no chances. KPRF bet to Grudinin instead of Zyuagnov and I think it is a good idea.

Pozner program introduced to me Boris Titov and Ksenia Sobchak. I got information about personalities. I like Titov ideas especcialy Stolipin's club. I read about his biography and Iam going to read political manifest. I think he has no lacks and promotion in internet, media. In this case he can adopt some Navalny experience.

An Appeal to ignore elections is a bad idea because choose will be made all the same.

Navalny will skip the elections. I do not want to find a reason but it is a fact. I appeal to find another candidate, consider his person, manifest, team and make choice. If all of them seems then choose less of 2 evils.

If you are fan and think that Navalny is right and want to ignore elections than think about he right now he ask to ignore election, next, don't pay a tax and so on. You are not flock of sheeps.

I appeal to all to elect president and accept any new president.
